# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction (Regression Model)

This project predicts a student's **exam score** based on lifestyle, academic, and personal factors.  
It uses **Machine Learning (Regression)** and is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit Web App**.

## 🧠 Problem Motivation

Students’ academic performance is influenced by many factors such as study hours, attendance,
sleep, and motivation.  
The goal of this project is to:

- Help students understand which factors impact their performance.
- Provide an early prediction of their expected exam score.
- Assist teachers and parents in identifying at-risk students.

## 🧾 Dataset

- **Name:** Student Performance Factors Dataset  
- **Type:** Tabular data (CSV)  
- **Target Variable:** `Exam_Score` (continuous value – regression)  
- **Example Features:**
  - Hours Studied  
  - Attendance  
  - Sleep Hours  
  - Internet Access  
  - Parental Education Level  
  - Gender  
  - Motivation Level  

> The dataset was cleaned, preprocessed, and used to train a regression model to predict the exam score.

## 🧮 Machine Learning Approach

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Checked missing values and outliers.
   - Visualized distributions and correlations between features and exam score.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values.
   - Encoded categorical variables (e.g., gender, parental education).
   - Scaled numerical features where needed.
   - Split data into **train** and **test** sets.

3. **Models Tried**
   - Linear Regression  
   - Random Forest Regressor  
   - XGBoost Regressor *(optional if you used it)*  

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics: **R² Score**, **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
   - Selected the best model based on test performance.
   - Saved the final model to `best_model.pkl`.
